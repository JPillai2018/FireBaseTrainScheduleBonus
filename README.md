# This is a demostration of firebase database application.  
# This app is accepting inputs and updates the firebase database realtime and refreshes the UI.
# Also lets the user maintain delete database rows.
# In this version I tried to  add the following features
# 1. Added Update and Delete capability
# 2. For Update and Delete, a row ,ust be selected from the table/grid
# 3. Once row is selected for maintenance, Add button will be disabled and Update/Delete button will be enabled.
# 4. Selected values will be loaded on to the Details window for editing
# 5. Train number is the key. Once selected for modify/delete, Key  will be disabled and cannot be changed.
# 6. After changing, update button should be pressed to update the record
# 7. Update was successful. But I could not get the refreshed data on to the table.  
# 8. Delete is performed by clicking the delete button.
# 9. I could not make refresh after successfully deleting the record.
# 10.A few more enhancements required are validation messages when try to add a  duplicate record.
# 11.Display a message once record is added, modified and deleted.
# 12.I don't know how to refresh the screen/table from entire cintent of the database when one record is deleted or modified.
# 13. Future Enhancements include realtime refresh of UI as soon as the database is updated either by changing row values or deleting row values.
